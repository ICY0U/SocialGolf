# ?? Camera Control Fixes - Complete!

## ? **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Normal Controls in Camera Mode ?**
- **Player can still move** when in camera view mode
- **Player can still look around** while viewing through camera
- **All normal controls work** (WASD, mouse look, jump, etc.)
- **Camera view is just visual** - doesn't lock player movement

### **2. Camera Mesh Visibility Fixed ?**
- **Camera stays visible** when picked up (no longer disappears)
- **Camera appears in player's hands** at realistic position
- **Visual feedback** shows you're carrying the camera
- **Proper handheld positioning** with slight tilt

## ?? **How It Works Now:**

### **Picking Up Camera:**
- **F key**: Pick up camera
- **Camera becomes visible in your hands** (forward and to the right)
- **Physics disabled** but camera stays visible
- **Interaction disabled** until dropped

### **Camera View Mode (T key):**
- **Switch to camera perspective** without losing controls
- **You can still:**
  - Move with WASD
  - Look around with mouse
  - Jump, crouch, etc.
  - All normal player controls work
- **Camera view shows** what the camera sees while you control the player

### **Dropping Camera (G key):**
- **Camera drops** in front of player

## ?? **Perfect Content Warning Experience:**

## ?? **Test the Improvements:**

1. **Pick up camera** (F) - should see camera in your hands
2. **Move around** - camera moves with you, stays visible
3. **Toggle view** (T) - switch to camera perspective but keep all controls
4. **Walk while in camera view** - you can move normally
5. **Drop camera** (G) - camera falls naturally, ready for pickup

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ? Camera visible in hands when carried
