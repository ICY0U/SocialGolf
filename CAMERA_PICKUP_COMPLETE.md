# ?? Camera Pickup System - Complete Implementation

## ?? System Overview

You now have a fully functional camera pickup system that transforms your stationary cameras into portable recording devices! Here's what's been implemented:

### ? **Core Features:**
- **?? Pickupable Cameras**: Players can pick up cameras with **F**
- **?? View Toggle**: Press **T** to switch between player and camera view
- **?? Drop System**: Press **G** to drop cameras
- **?? Recording**: Record while in camera view or from player perspective
- **?? Save Integration**: Works with your existing save system
- **?? Interaction Integration**: Seamless with SGInteractionComponent

## ?? **New Files Created:**

### Camera Pickup System:
- `Source/SocialGolf/Camera/SGPickupableCamera.h/cpp` - Pickupable camera actor
- `Source/SocialGolf/Camera/SGCameraManager.h/cpp` - Camera management component

### Documentation:
- `INPUT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Input configuration instructions
- `CHARACTER_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.md` - Character integration guide

## ?? **How It Works:**

### **1. Pickup Flow:**
```
Player approaches camera ? Press F ? Camera attaches to player ? Ready to use
```

### **2. View Toggle:**
```
Press T ? Switch to camera view ? See through camera lens
Press T again ? Return to player view ? Normal gameplay
```

### **3. Recording:**
```
While in camera view ? Recording captures first-person perspective
While in player view ? Camera still records from its position
```

### **4. Drop System:**
```
Press G ? Camera drops in front of player ? Camera becomes pickupable again
```

## ??? **Setup Required:**

### **1. Input Actions** (Required!)
Add these to **Project Settings > Engine > Input > Action Mappings**:

| Action Name | Key | Description |
|-------------|-----|-------------|
| `ToggleCamera` | T | Toggle camera view |
| `DropCamera` | G | Drop held camera |

### **2. Character Integration** 
Choose one option:

**Option A: Blueprint** (Recommended)
1. Open your Character Blueprint
2. Add Component ? Search "SGCameraManager"
3. In Event Graph:
   - **InputAction ToggleCamera** ? **Toggle Camera View**
   - **InputAction DropCamera** ? **Drop Camera**

**Option B: C++** (Advanced)
```cpp
// Add to your character class
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Camera")
USGCameraManager* CameraManager;

// In constructor:
CameraManager = CreateDefaultSubobject<USGCameraManager>(TEXT("CameraManager"));
```

### **3. Level Setup:**
1. Delete old stationary cameras
2. Place new **SGPickupableCamera** actors
3. Players can now pick them up and carry them

## ?? **Usage Examples:**

### **Content Warning Style Gameplay:**
```cpp
// Players pick up cameras
// Explore and record interesting moments  
// Toggle between views for different perspectives
// Drop cameras in strategic locations
// Review recordings later
```

### **Recording Scenarios:**
- **First-Person Recording**: Hold camera and record while walking
- **Security Camera**: Drop camera to monitor an area
- **Action Shots**: Place camera and perform stunts in view
- **Group Recording**: Drop camera to record multiple players

## ?? **Advanced Features:**

### **Camera Manager Events:**
```cpp
// Listen for view changes
CameraManager->OnCameraViewChanged.AddDynamic(this, &AMyActor::OnViewChanged);

// Check current state
bool bHasCamera = CameraManager->HasCamera();
bool bInCameraView = CameraManager->IsCameraViewActive();
```

### **Recording Controls:**
```cpp
// Manual recording control
CameraManager->StartRecording();
CameraManager->StopRecording();
bool bIsRecording = CameraManager->IsRecording();
```

### **Programmatic Camera Management:**
```cpp
// Force pickup
CameraManager->PickUpCamera(SomeCamera);

// Force drop
CameraManager->DropCamera();

// Get current camera
ASGPickupableCamera* CurrentCam = CameraManager->GetCurrentCamera();
```

## ?? **Integration Benefits:**

### **? Works With Existing Systems:**
- **Interaction System**: F key pickup uses SGInteractionComponent
- **Save System**: Recordings save through existing save architecture
- **Network**: Ready for multiplayer implementation
- **UI**: On-screen feedback for all actions

### **? Flexible Design:**
- Cameras work both picked up and placed
- Recording from multiple perspectives
- Easy to extend with new features
- Blueprint and C++ friendly

## ?? **Player Experience:**

### **Intuitive Controls:**
- **F**: Pick up camera (familiar interaction)
- **T**: Toggle view (easy to remember - "Toggle")
- **G**: Drop item (standard gaming convention - "Give up")

### **Visual Feedback:**
- On-screen messages for all actions
- Clear indication of current view mode
- Recording status updates
- Error messages when appropriate

## ?? **Next Steps:**

### **Immediate (Ready to Use):**
1. ? Add input actions to Project Settings
2. ? Add SGCameraManager to your character
3. ? Place SGPickupableCamera actors in levels
4. ? Test the pickup, toggle, and drop functionality

### **Future Enhancements:**
- **Multiple Cameras**: Allow carrying multiple cameras
- **Camera Types**: Different camera models with unique properties
- **Battery System**: Limited recording time per camera
- **Zoom/Focus**: Camera lens controls while in camera view
- **Sharing**: Trade cameras between players

## ?? **Troubleshooting:**

### **Camera Won't Pick Up:**
- ? Check SGCameraManager is on character
- ? Verify F key interaction works with other objects
- ? Ensure camera has interaction sphere collision

### **Toggle Not Working:**
- ? Add "ToggleCamera" input action (T key)
- ? Check input bindings in character
- ? Verify you have a camera picked up

### **Drop Not Working:**
- ? Add "DropCamera" input action (G key)  
- ? Check you're holding a camera
- ? Verify drop location calculation

### **View Stuck in Camera:**
- ? Press T to toggle back
- ? Drop camera with G and pick up again
- ? Restart level if needed

## ?? **You're All Set!**

Your camera system now provides the complete Content Warning experience:

- ? **Pick up cameras** with F
- ? **Toggle views** with T  
- ? **Record footage** from both perspectives
- ? **Drop cameras** strategically with G
- ? **Save recordings** automatically
- ? **Integrate perfectly** with existing systems

**Time to start recording some amazing gameplay moments!** ??
