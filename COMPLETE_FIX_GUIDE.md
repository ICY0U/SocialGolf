# ?? Complete Camera Pickup Fix Guide

## ? **What's Fixed in Code:**
- ? Camera is now much smaller (realistic handheld size)
- ? Better camera positioning when held
- ? Improved camera view switching
- ? Real-time camera view rendering

## ?? **What You Need to Do:**

### **1. CRITICAL: Add Input Actions**
This is why T and G keys don't work!

**Steps:**
1. **Edit ? Project Settings**
2. **Engine ? Input** 
3. **Action Mappings ? + Add these:**

| Action Name | Key |
|-------------|-----|
| `ToggleCamera` | T |
| `DropCamera` | G |
| `Interact` | F |

**Visual Setup:**
```
Action Mappings
??? Interact ? F
??? ToggleCamera ? T  
??? DropCamera ? G
```

### **2. Test the Fixed System**

After adding input actions:

1. **Compile/Build** your project
2. **Play the game**
3. **Test the sequence:**
   - Walk to camera
   - **Press F** ? Pick up camera (should see smaller camera size)
   - **Press T** ? Switch to camera view (first-person camera perspective)
   - **Press T again** ? Switch back to player view
   - **Press G** ? Drop camera

### **3. Expected Behavior:**

**Camera Size:** Much smaller, realistic handheld camera size

**Camera View (T key):**
- **Player View:** Normal third-person or first-person player view
- **Camera View:** See through the camera lens (like holding a camcorder)

**Camera Position:** Held at chest/shoulder level when picked up

## ?? **If Still Not Working:**

### **Check Input Actions:**
1. Open **Project Settings ? Input**
2. Verify all three actions exist with correct keys
3. **Compile** the project

### **Check Character:**
1. Your character should have **SGCameraManager** component
2. Check the **Output Log** for error messages

### **Debug Steps:**
1. Press **F** near camera ? Should see "Camera picked up!" message
2. Press **T** ? Should see "CAMERA VIEW ON" or "PLAYER VIEW ON" message  
3. Press **G** ? Should see "Camera dropped" message

### **Common Issues:**
- **No messages when pressing T/G** = Input actions not set up
- **"No camera manager" error** = Component missing from character
- **View doesn't change** = Camera view target issue

## ?? **How the Camera View Should Work:**

### **Player View Mode:**
- See your character from normal camera angle
- Camera is visible in your hands (small, realistic size)

### **Camera View Mode (Press T):**
- Switch to first-person view through camera lens
- See what the camera is recording
- Like looking through a viewfinder

### **Recording:**
- Works in both view modes
- Camera records what it "sees" from its position

## ?? **Final Test Checklist:**

- [ ] Input actions added (T, G keys)
- [ ] Project compiled after adding inputs
- [ ] Camera pickup works (F key)
- [ ] Camera is small, realistic size
- [ ] T key switches between player/camera view
- [ ] G key drops the camera
- [ ] On-screen messages appear for all actions

**Once input actions are added, everything should work perfectly!** 

The code changes make the camera smaller and improve the view switching - you just need the input actions to activate the T and G key functionality.
