# Distance-Based Rendering System for SocialGolf

## Overview

The Distance-Based Rendering System is a performance optimization system designed specifically for SocialGolf that automatically adjusts the Level of Detail (LOD) and visibility of objects based on their distance from players. This is crucial for maintaining smooth performance in large golf course environments with many objects.

## Features

- **Automatic LOD Management**: Dynamically adjusts mesh LOD levels based on distance
- **Distance-Based Culling**: Completely hides objects beyond a specified distance
- **Performance Optimization**: Batch processing and async updates to minimize frame time impact
- **Blueprint Integration**: Full Blueprint support for easy setup and configuration
- **Multiplayer Support**: Calculates distance to nearest player in multiplayer scenarios
- **Flexible Configuration**: Multiple preset configurations for different object types
- **Real-time Statistics**: Performance monitoring and debugging tools

## Core Components

### 1. SGDistanceRenderingTypes.h
Contains the fundamental data structures:
- `EDistanceRenderingLevel`: Enum defining rendering quality levels
- `FSGDistanceRenderingSettings`: Configuration structure for distance thresholds
- `FSGObjectRenderingData`: Runtime data for tracked objects
- Event delegates for performance monitoring

### 2. USGDistanceRenderingComponent
The main component that should be added to actors that need distance-based rendering:
- Automatically registers with the rendering manager
- Calculates distance to nearest player
- Applies LOD changes to mesh components
- Handles visibility toggling

### 3. USGDistanceRenderingManager
World subsystem that manages all distance rendering operations:
- Centralized management of all registered objects
- Batch processing for performance optimization
- Player position caching
- Statistics tracking and performance monitoring

### 4. USGDistanceRenderingBlueprintLibrary
Blueprint function library providing easy access to the system:
- Helper functions for setup and configuration
- Bulk operations for multiple actors
- Preset configurations for different object types
- Debug and statistics functions

## Quick Setup Guide

### Method 1: Blueprint Setup

1. **Enable for Individual Actors:**
   ```cpp
   // In Blueprint, call: Add Distance Rendering to Actor
   AddDistanceRenderingToActor(TargetActor, GetDefaultDistanceRenderingSettings())
   ```

2. **Enable for Multiple Actors by Tag:**
   ```cpp
   // Setup all actors with tag "EnvironmentObject"
   SetupDistanceRenderingForActorsWithTag(this, "EnvironmentObject", GetEnvironmentObjectRenderingSettings())
   ```

3. **Enable for All Actors of a Class:**
   ```cpp
   // Setup all StaticMeshActor instances
   SetupDistanceRenderingForActorsOfClass(this, StaticMeshActor::StaticClass(), GetGolfCourseRenderingSettings())
   ```

### Method 2: C++ Setup

1. **Add Component to Actor:**
   ```cpp
   // In your Actor's constructor
   DistanceRenderingComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<USGDistanceRenderingComponent>(TEXT("DistanceRendering"));
   DistanceRenderingComponent->RenderingSettings = USGDistanceRenderingBlueprintLibrary::GetEnvironmentObjectRenderingSettings();
   ```

2. **Manual Registration:**
   ```cpp
   // Get the manager and register component
   if (USGDistanceRenderingManager* Manager = USGDistanceRenderingManager::Get(this))
   {
       Manager->RegisterObject(DistanceRenderingComponent);
   }
   ```

## Configuration Presets

The system includes several preset configurations optimized for different types of objects:

### Golf Course Settings
- **Use Case**: Large golf course structures, clubhouses, major landmarks
- **Very High Detail**: 10 meters
- **Culling Distance**: 300 meters
- **Update Frequency**: 15 FPS

### Environment Object Settings  
- **Use Case**: Trees, rocks, buildings, decorative objects
- **Very High Detail**: 8 meters
- **Culling Distance**: 250 meters
- **Update Frequency**: 10 FPS

### Vegetation Settings
- **Use Case**: Grass, small plants, flowers, foliage
- **Very High Detail**: 3 meters
- **Culling Distance**: 80 meters
- **Update Frequency**: 8 FPS

### UI Element Settings
- **Use Case**: Signs, markers, scoreboards, UI elements
- **Very High Detail**: 5 meters
- **Culling Distance**: 120 meters
- **Update Frequency**: 20 FPS

## Distance Levels Explained

1. **Very High Detail (0-5m)**: Full quality, all details visible
2. **High Detail (5-15m)**: Minor LOD reduction, barely noticeable
3. **Medium Detail (15-30m)**: Moderate LOD reduction, good for mid-range
4. **Low Detail (30-60m)**: Significant LOD reduction, major features only
5. **Very Low Detail (60-100m)**: Minimal detail, basic shape only
6. **None (100m+)**: Object completely hidden/culled

## Performance Optimization Features

### Batch Processing
- Maximum objects updated per frame (configurable)
- Spreads updates across multiple frames to maintain consistent FPS
- Priority-based processing (closer objects updated first)

### Async Updates
- Optional background thread processing for distance calculations
- Reduces main thread load
- Configurable via `bUseAsyncUpdates` setting

### Smart Caching
- Player position caching to avoid repeated calculations
- Component caching for faster LOD application
- Reduced garbage collection pressure

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Statistics Available:
- Total registered objects
- Currently visible objects
- Culled objects count
- Average distance to players
- Update performance metrics

### Debug Functions:
```cpp
// Show performance statistics
USGDistanceRenderingBlueprintLibrary::ShowDistanceRenderingStats(this);

// Toggle system on/off for testing
USGDistanceRenderingBlueprintLibrary::ToggleDistanceRenderingDebug(this);

// Force update all objects immediately
USGDistanceRenderingBlueprintLibrary::ForceUpdateAllDistanceRendering(this);
```

### Console Commands:
- `ToggleDistanceRendering`: Enable/disable the system
- `ResetAllObjects`: Reset all objects to highest detail
- `ShowDebugInfo`: Display current statistics

## Integration with Golf Ball

The system is designed to work seamlessly with the existing SGGolfBall system:

```cpp
// Example: Make golf ball always high priority
if (USGDistanceRenderingComponent* RenderingComp = GolfBall->FindComponentByClass<USGDistanceRenderingComponent>())
{
    RenderingComp->ImportanceMultiplier = 3.0f; // Always render at 3x closer distance
    RenderingComp->bIgnoreDistanceRendering = false; // Ensure it participates in system
}
```

## Performance Impact

Expected performance improvements:
- **30-60% FPS increase** in dense object environments
- **Reduced GPU load** through intelligent LOD management
- **Lower memory usage** via distance-based culling
- **Scalable performance** that adapts to player count and course size

## Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Presets**: Choose the right preset for each object type
2. **Tag Your Objects**: Use consistent tags for bulk setup operations
3. **Test Different Settings**: Tune distance thresholds based on your specific course layout
4. **Monitor Performance**: Use the built-in statistics to track system impact
5. **Consider Importance**: Use `ImportanceMultiplier` for critical objects
6. **Batch Setup**: Use bulk operations rather than individual actor setup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Objects Not Updating**: 
   - Ensure the manager is enabled: `EnableDistanceRendering(true)`
   - Check if component is registered with manager

2. **Poor Performance**:
   - Reduce `MaxUpdatesPerFrame`
   - Increase `UpdateFrequency` interval
   - Enable `bUseAsyncUpdates`

3. **Objects Disappearing Too Early**:
   - Increase distance thresholds in settings
   - Check `ImportanceMultiplier` values
   - Verify preset selection is appropriate

4. **LOD Not Changing**:
   - Ensure meshes have multiple LOD levels
   - Check component caching is working
   - Verify distance calculations are correct

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Hierarchical distance rendering for complex objects
- Integration with Unreal's Nanite virtualized geometry
- Custom LOD strategies per object type
- Performance profiler integration
- Automatic distance threshold tuning based on hardware

This system provides a solid foundation for managing rendering performance in large-scale golf environments while maintaining visual quality where it matters most.
