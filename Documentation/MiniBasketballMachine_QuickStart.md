# Mini Basketball Machine - Quick Start Guide

## What We've Built

You now have a fully functional **arcade-style mini basketball machine** with:
- ?? 30-second timed gameplay
- ?? Auto-spawning basketballs (3 balls)
- ?? Live score tracking
- ? Countdown timer
- ?? High score system
- ?? Sound effect support
- ?? Full multiplayer support

## Files Created

### C++ Source Files:
```
Source/SocialGolf/Basketball/
??? SGMiniBasketballMachine.h      (Header file)
??? SGMiniBasketballMachine.cpp    (Implementation)
```

### Documentation:
```
Documentation/
??? MiniBasketballMachineSetup.md  (Full setup guide)
```

## Next Steps - What YOU Need to Do

### 1. Compile the Code (5 minutes)
Since we added new C++ classes, you need to compile them:

**Option A - Via Unreal Editor:**
1. Close Unreal Editor (if open)
2. Open the project - it will ask to rebuild, click **Yes**
3. Wait for compilation to complete

**Option B - Via Visual Studio:**
1. Right-click `SocialGolf.uproject` ? "Generate Visual Studio project files"
2. Open `SocialGolf.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Build Solution (F7)
4. Open Unreal Editor

### 2. Create Blueprint (2 minutes)
Once compiled, create a Blueprint version:

1. **In Unreal Editor**, open Content Browser
2. Navigate to `/Content/Basketball/` or create `/Content/BballMini/`
3. Right-click ? **Blueprint Class**
4. Expand "All Classes" at bottom
5. Search for: `SGMiniBasketballMachine`
6. Select it, name it: `BP_MiniBasketballMachine`
7. **Save** the Blueprint

### 3. Place in Level (1 minute)
1. Drag `BP_MiniBasketballMachine` into your level
2. Position it in your basketball area
3. Rotate so front faces players (ball return area)

### 4. Test It! (30 seconds)
1. Click **Play** in editor
2. Walk up to the machine
3. You should see: "PRESS TO START" on the display
4. Walk into the front area (interaction zone)
5. Game should auto-start (or you can trigger it via Blueprint)

## How Players Use It

```
1. Player approaches machine
   ?
2. Sees "PRESS TO START" on display
   ?
3. Walks into interaction zone (front of machine)
   ?
4. Game starts! (3 basketballs spawn)
   ?
5. Timer counts down: 30... 29... 28...
   ?
6. Player picks up balls and shoots
   ?
7. Each basket = 2 points
   ?
8. Time runs out ? Final score shown
   ?
9. High score saved (if beat)
   ?
10. Machine resets, ready for next player
```

## Current Interaction Method

The machine currently auto-starts when a player enters the interaction zone. If you want to add a button press (like 'E' key), you need to:

### Option 1: Add to Your Character's Input
In `SGCharacter.cpp`, add:

```cpp
// In SetupPlayerInputComponent()
InputComponent->BindAction("Interact", IE_Pressed, this, &ASGCharacter::OnInteract);

// Add this function:
void ASGCharacter::OnInteract()
{
    // Check if near a mini basketball machine
    // Call machine->StartGame(this);
}
```

### Option 2: Use Blueprint
In `BP_MiniBasketballMachine`:
1. Add "Interact" prompt widget when player is near
2. When player presses 'E', call `Start Game` function
3. Pass player reference

## Customization in Blueprint

Open `BP_MiniBasketballMachine` and modify these settings:

### Game Settings (Details Panel):
| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Game Duration | 30.0 | Game length in seconds |
| Points Per Basket | 2 | Score per successful shot |
| Number Of Balls | 3 | Basketballs to spawn |
| Ball Return Delay | 1.0 | Seconds before balls despawn |
| Minimum Scoring Velocity Z | -100.0 | How fast ball must fall |
| Play Sounds | true | Enable sound effects |
| Show Debug Info | false | Show collision zones |

### Visual Customization:
- Replace meshes with your own 3D models
- Adjust positions/scales of components
- Add lights, particles, materials
- Customize display text colors

## Adding Custom Behavior (Blueprint)

You can add Blueprint events:

### Example: Play Animation on Score
1. Open `BP_MiniBasketballMachine`
2. Event Graph ? Add Event ? **Event On Scored**
3. Add nodes: Play Animation, Spawn Particles, etc.

### Example: Show UI Widget
```
Event OnGameStarted
  ? Create Widget (WBP_BasketballTimer)
  ? Add to Viewport

Event OnGameEnded
  ? Remove Widget
  ? Create Widget (WBP_FinalScore)
```

### Example: Give Rewards
```
Event OnGameEnded
  ? Get Final Score
  ? If Score > 20
    ? Give Player Currency (100 coins)
  ? If New High Score
    ? Give Achievement
```

## Testing Checklist

Before showing to players:

- [ ] **Compile succeeds** - No build errors
- [ ] **Blueprint created** - BP_MiniBasketballMachine exists
- [ ] **Placed in level** - Machine is in world
- [ ] **Basketballs spawn** - 3 balls appear at front
- [ ] **Timer counts down** - From 30 to 0
- [ ] **Scoring works** - Making baskets adds points
- [ ] **Game ends** - Stops at 0 seconds
- [ ] **High score saves** - Persists between games
- [ ] **Displays update** - Shows score and time
- [ ] **Machine resets** - Ready for next player

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### ? "Can't find SGMiniBasketballMachine class"
**Fix**: Project hasn't been compiled yet. Close editor, regenerate project files, rebuild.

### ? Basketballs don't spawn
**Fix**: Check `NumberOfBalls` is > 0 in Details panel.

### ? Scoring doesn't work
**Fix**: Enable `Show Debug Info` to see collision zones. Make sure they're positioned around the hoop.

### ? Timer doesn't show
**Fix**: Check `TimerDisplay` component exists and is facing the right direction.

### ? Game doesn't start
**Fix**: Make sure player is a `ASGCharacter` type and walks into the blue interaction zone.

## What's Next?

### Immediate Improvements:
1. **Add Input Binding** - Make player press 'E' to start
2. **Create UI Widgets** - Pretty score displays
3. **Add Sound Effects** - Find/create audio files
4. **Visual Polish** - Add materials, lights, effects

### Future Features:
1. **Difficulty Levels** - Easy/Medium/Hard modes
2. **Power-Ups** - Special golden balls worth more
3. **Multiplayer Tournament** - Multiple machines, competition
4. **Leaderboard System** - Global high scores
5. **Ticket System** - Award prizes based on score
6. **Mini-Game Variations** - Different challenges

### Integration Options:
1. **Currency System** - Cost coins to play, win prizes
2. **Achievement System** - Unlock rewards for high scores
3. **Quest System** - "Score 50 points in basketball"
4. **Social Features** - Share scores with friends

## Architecture Overview

The machine is self-contained and manages:
- ? Game state (timer, score, active player)
- ? Basketball spawning/despawning
- ? Collision detection (scoring validation)
- ? Display updates (score/timer)
- ? High score tracking
- ? Multiplayer replication
- ? Sound effects

## File Relationships

```
SGMiniBasketballMachine (Your new class)
    ? Uses
SGBasketball (Existing basketball class)
    ? Interacts with
SGCharacter (Your player character)
```

The machine is **independent** of `SGBasketballGameManager` - it doesn't need it!

## Performance Notes

- **Lightweight**: Only active when game is running
- **Multiplayer**: Server-authoritative, prevents cheating
- **Memory**: Cleans up basketballs automatically
- **Optimized**: Uses timers efficiently, minimal tick usage

## Need Help?

1. **Check logs**: Window ? Developer Tools ? Output Log
2. **Enable debug**: Set `Show Debug Info = true` in Details
3. **Review docs**: See `MiniBasketballMachineSetup.md`
4. **Test in isolation**: Place machine alone in empty level
