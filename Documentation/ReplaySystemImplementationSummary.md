# SocialGolf Replay System Implementation Summary

## Successfully Implemented Components

### ? 1. Core Data Structures (`SGReplayTypes.h`)
- **FSGReplayFrameData**: Stores position, rotation, and camera data per frame
- **FSGReplayEvent**: Records significant events (golf shots, hole completions)
- **FSGReplayData**: Complete replay session data with metadata
- **ECameraReplayMode**: Seven different camera viewing modes
- **EReplayEventType**: Various event types for enhanced replays

### ? 2. Replay Manager (`SGReplayManager.h/.cpp`)
- **Recording Features**:
  - 30fps frame recording with configurable frame rate
  - Automatic golf shot event recording
  - Max duration limits (5 minutes default)
  - Pause/resume recording capabilities

- **Playback Features**:
  - Multiple camera modes (cinematic, ball follow, static overview, etc.)
  - Variable playback speed (0.1x to 5.0x)
  - Frame interpolation for smooth playback
  - Auto camera switching during playback

- **File Management**:
  - JSON-based save/load system
  - Automatic file naming with timestamps
  - Replay browser and deletion capabilities
  - Save directory: `[ProjectSavedDir]/Replays/`

### ? 3. UI System (`SGReplayWidget.h/.cpp`)
- **Recording Controls**: Start, stop, pause recording
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, scrub timeline, speed control
- **Camera Controls**: Mode switching, manual camera changes
- **Replay Management**: Load, save, delete replay files
- **Real-time Updates**: Recording time, playback progress, event notifications

### ? 4. Player Controller Integration
- **Input Bindings**:
  - `F8`: Toggle recording
  - `F9`: Quick save replay
  - `F10`: Open/close replay UI
  - `F11`: Play last recorded replay
  - `Ctrl+C`: Next camera during playback

- **Auto-Recording**: Triggers on golf shots when enabled
- **UI Management**: Widget creation and input mode switching

### ? 5. Build System Updates
- Updated `SocialGolf.Build.cs` with JSON dependencies
- Added replay directory to include paths
- Integrated with existing camera and save systems

## Key Features Working

### ?? Camera System
- **Cinematic Mode**: Orbiting camera around action points
- **Ball Follow**: Dynamic camera following ball trajectory
- **Static Overview**: High-angle course overview
- **First/Third Person**: Traditional player perspectives
- **Side View**: Profile angle for shot analysis
- **Behind Shot**: Camera positioned behind shot direction

### ?? Event System
- **Golf Shot Recording**: Power, club type, location data
- **Hole Completion**: Final score tracking
- **Custom Events**: Extensible for future features
- **Timeline Integration**: Events linked to playback timeline

### ?? Data Management
- **JSON Serialization**: Human-readable save format
- **Metadata**: Player name, date, course info, duration
- **File Organization**: Automatic directory structure
- **Error Handling**: Robust save/load with fallbacks

## Usage Instructions

### Recording Replays
```cpp
// Manual recording
PlayerController->StartReplayRecording();
// ... play golf ...
PlayerController->StopReplayRecording(); // Auto-saves

// Or use hotkeys: F8 to toggle, F9 to quick save
```

### Playing Replays
```cpp
// Load and play specific replay
ReplayManager->LoadReplay("ReplayFileName");
FSGReplayData Data = ReplayManager->GetCurrentReplayData();
ReplayManager->StartPlayback(Data, ECameraReplayMode::Cinematic);

// Or use hotkey: F11 to play last replay
```

### Opening UI
```cpp
// Programmatically open replay browser
PlayerController->OpenReplayUI();

// Or use hotkey: F10
```

## Next Steps for Enhancement

### Immediate Improvements
1. **UI Polish**: Create proper Blueprint widgets with visual styling
2. **Replay Thumbnails**: Generate preview images for replay browser
3. **Event Markers**: Visual timeline indicators for important moments
4. **Export Features**: Save replays as video files

### Advanced Features
1. **Multi-Angle Compilation**: Automatic highlight reels
2. **Slow Motion**: Time manipulation effects
3. **Ghost Players**: Compare multiple runs
4. **Cloud Sharing**: Upload/download community replays
5. **Commentary System**: Add voice or text annotations

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Compression**: Reduce file sizes for longer recordings
2. **Streaming**: Load large replays progressively
3. **LOD System**: Reduce quality for distant objects during recording
4. **Memory Management**: Better cleanup of replay data
