# ?? Super Simple Camera System - All in One!

## ? **Much Simpler Solution!**

I've created **SGSimplePickupableCamera** - everything is now in one class! No character modifications needed, no components to add.

## ?? **How to Test Immediately:**

### **1. Place Camera in Level:**
1. In Content Browser, find **SGSimplePickupableCamera** (compile first)
2. Create a Blueprint from it (Right-click ? Blueprint Class)
3. Place it in your level

### **2. Test the Camera:**
1. **Walk to camera**
2. **Press F** ? Pick up camera (becomes tiny)
3. **Press T** ? Toggle between player/camera view
4. **Press G** ? Drop camera

## ?? **What This Does:**

### **Automatic Input Binding:**
- When you pick up the camera, it **automatically** adds T and G key bindings
- When you drop the camera, it **automatically** removes those bindings
- **No character modifications needed!**

### **Complete Functionality:**
- ? **Pickup**: F key (uses your existing interaction)
- ? **Camera View Toggle**: T key (switches to camera perspective)  
- ? **Drop**: G key (places camera in front of you)
- ? **Realistic Size**: Tiny handheld camera
- ? **Visual Feedback**: On-screen messages for everything

## ?? **Why This Works Better:**

### **Self-Contained:**
- All logic in one class
- No dependencies on character components
- No input action setup required
- Works with any character

### **Automatic:**
- Input binding happens when picked up
- Input unbinding happens when dropped
- No manual setup required

### **Clean:**
- No complex manager systems
- No multiple components to track
- Simple and reliable

## ?? **Testing Steps:**

1. **Compile** the project
2. **Create Blueprint** from SGSimplePickupableCamera
3. **Place in level**
4. **Play game**
5. **Test sequence:**
   - Walk to camera
   - **F** = Pick up (see "Camera Controls: T=Toggle View, G=Drop" message)
   - **T** = Switch to camera view (see "CAMERA VIEW ON" message)
   - **T** = Switch back (see "PLAYER VIEW ON" message)
   - **G** = Drop camera (see "Camera dropped" message)

## ?? **Expected Behavior:**

### **Camera Size:**
Much smaller, realistic handheld camera size

### **Camera View (T key):**
- **Player View**: Normal character perspective
- **Camera View**: First-person through camera lens

### **Controls:**
- **F**: Pick up camera (existing interaction system)
- **T**: Toggle camera view (auto-bound when picked up)
- **G**: Drop camera (auto-bound when picked up)

## ?? **Perfect for Content Warning Style:**

- Pick up cameras around the level
- Record from character perspective OR camera perspective
- Switch views while recording for different angles
- Drop cameras in strategic locations
- Multiple cameras can be placed and used

**This is much cleaner and should work immediately without any character modifications!** ??

Just place the **SGSimplePickupableCamera** in your level and test it out!
